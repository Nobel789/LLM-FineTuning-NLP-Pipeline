# LLM-FineTuning-NLP-Pipeline
Developed a comprehensive pipeline for Large Language Model (LLM) optimization, focusing on memory-efficient training and specialized NLP agents.
LLM Fine-Tuning and NLP Pipeline
This repository focuses on the end-to-end lifecycle of Large Language Models (LLMs), from raw text preprocessing to memory-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and agent deployment.

🚀 Key Features
Memory-Efficient Training: Comprehensive comparison between traditional fine-tuning, LoRA, and QLoRA, focusing on time and memory optimization.

Clinical NLP: Specialized fine-tuning for multi-label adverse event classification from clinical text.

Advanced Preprocessing: Custom regex-based cleaning and SpaCy-powered pipelines for POS tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER).

Intelligent Agents: Design of a troubleshooting agent and sentiment analysis using DistilBERT.

📂 Project Structure
preprocessing/: Notebooks for LLM data preparation and linguistic feature extraction.

fine-tuning/: Implementation of QLoRA techniques and performance benchmarking.

agents/: Applications including sentiment pipelines and intelligent troubleshooting.
